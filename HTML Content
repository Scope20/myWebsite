                    <b>Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)</b> are information-processing computer
                    systems
                    <br>
                    inspired by biological neural networks found in the brains of
                    animals.
                    <br>
                    The structures of ANNs vary but generally they are composed of a large
                    number of
                    <br>
                    hierarchical, non-linear and highly interconnected nodes
                    working together to solve
                    <br>
                    a specific problem.

                    <h3>How does an Artificial Neural Network learn?</h3>

                    <p>
                    An ANNs main function is to recieve a set of inputs, perform progressively complex calculations, <br>
                    and then use the output to solve a problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In order to get an idea of how ANNs learn we first need to understand <b>Classification.</b><br>
                    Classification is the process of categorizing a group of objects, while only using some basic data<br>features that describe them.
                    </p>
                    <p>As an example, if we trained a ANN to recognise different modes of transport and then gave it the<br> image below,
                    it should be able to correctly classify each individual mode of transport and differentiate<br>one from the other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    So how is a trained ANN able to do these kinds of tasks? Using our above example of transport recognition.<br>
                    The ANN would recieve data at its input layer (an image of a car, train, boat or plane), this data would<br>
                    move through subsequent layers (hidden layers) and at each layer it would be assigned a confidence score.
                    <br>The further down the layers we get, the more weighted this score becomes, when it reaches the output layer<br>
                    a final confidence score is assigned, this score determines whether the vehicle displayed in the data is a car,<br>train, boat or plane.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Of course this example is limited to image recgonition, however the process can be extrapolated to any
                    <br>process that requires highly complex, and repetitive pattern recognition.

                    <h3>What are Artificial Neural Networks used for?</h3>

                    <p>
                    The usefulness of ANNs falls into two categories: as tools for solving problems that are inherently difficult<br>
                    for both people and digital computers, and as experimental and conceptual models of something - namely, simulations. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Problem solving was the first real reason for intrest and investment in ANNs, for example Google uses an ANN to<br>better target Youtubes users "watch next" suggestions after videos.
                    Shipping companies use them to minimize route<br>lengths over a complex scattering of destinations. Credit card companies use them to identify fraudulent transactions.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    And this is just the tip of the iceberg, Googles photo-analysis algorithms are being continuously tranined and are able<br>to consistently tell cats from dogs in regular photographs.
                    Natural language processing is another exciting front, both<br>translation and voice synthesis are reaching a point where we might be able to own a device that would allow real time<br>
                    conversations between people speaking different languages. Google pixel-buds are an example of this kind of<br>technology today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Other notable achievements of ANNs include: Recognizing human emotions through facial expressions.<br>Reading a wide variety of cursive handwriting. Driving autonomously through busy streets.
                    <br>Beating a grand master at chess or winning on Jeopardy!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The other side of ANNs are simulations, particularly brain simulation. Brain simuation as it exists today is still a concept,<br> one firmly in its infancy.
                    Current understanding of brain structure, and the computational power necessary to simulate it,<br> are nowhere close to what weâ€™d need to do robust brain-science in a computer model.
                    <br>There have been some efforts, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Brain_Project">The Blue Brain Project</a>, that aimed to simulate certain aspects of brain function in
                    <br>certain portions of the brain, but it's still early days.
                    The exact reasons and goals for wanting to run a brain simulation<br>aren't yet fully defined but there are notable advantages should it be possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    For example, genetically modifying brains to have inherent changes built in could come under ethical scrutiny,<br> however performing such such tasks on simulated brains might be more palatable.
                    <br>Also, ANNs can explore a far wider array of possibilities than medicine ever practically could, which one day could allow<br> scientists to test hypotheses without real-world consequences.
